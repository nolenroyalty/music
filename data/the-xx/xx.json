    "free_form": "I have a pretty strong memory of listening to this album while snorting 2cb in Tim and my room at Grinnell about a month before I dropped out (if that).  It was a great night and we spent a bunch of time talking about the album - I think it was me, Clint, Tim, Mustafa, maybe someone else.  Rregardless, I've listened to it ~constantly since then.  It is probably(?) my single favorite album, and the idea that, in 2009 when doing a 'best albums of the year' ranking p4k decided to give best album to MPP and give this THIRD, I said THIRd, makes me lose my goddamn mind.  Someone should be fired over this.  Great album, thanks."
